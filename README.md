#AWS Lab : Building a VPC and Launching a Web Server

## 1. Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a custom **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** and the deployment of a web server hosted on an **Amazon EC2 instance**.  
The objective was to design a secure, scalable network environment with both public and private subnets and to configure routing, security, and compute resources in line with AWS best practices.

**Region Used:** N. Virginia (us-east-1)

## 2. Architecture Summary
The infrastructure was built from scratch using the **VPC Wizard** in the AWS Management Console and expanded with additional subnets to support high availability.
